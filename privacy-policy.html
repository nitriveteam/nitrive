				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <p><i>Last Updated: Friday, 25th May 2018</i></p>
                    <p>This policy covers Nitrive's use of personal information collected when you use Nitrive’s&nbsp;games, websites and related services we here collectively call ‘Services’.</p>
                    <p>We cannot do all the things needed to make and run the Services by ourselves so we share information with third parties collectively called our ‘Partners’.</p>
                    <h3>This policy covers:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What data is collect and how it is collect and stored.</li>
                        <li>What the data is used for.</li>
                        <li>What you can do.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What data is collect and how it is collect and stored</h3>

                    <h4>Data you enter in</h4>
                    <p>You can provide us data though our Services:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Basic Information – things like your name and an account name.</li>
                        <li>Contact information – such as an email address and Twitter account.</li>
                        <li>Profile information – including specific images used to identify you in games.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h4>Data we get automatically</h4>
                    <p>Nitrive and its Partners collect data from its Services automatically from the device, cookies, the service itself or from other Partner services we use. The data can include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic Information – things like your name and an account name.</li>
                        <li>Contact information – such as an email address and Twitter account.</li>
                        <li>Profile information – including specific images used to identify you in games.</li>
                        <li>Progress – data on your save file and unlocks.</li>
                        <li>Behaviour – information about how you interact with our Services.</li>
                        <li>Unique identifiers – this could be identifiers for devices and Advertising IDs.</li>
                        <li>Configuration – specifics such as browser used, language, general location, precise location (GPS if allowed) device type, version of software and operating system.</li>
                        <li>Demographic Data – such as your age range and interests, used for advertising and analytic grouping.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Data from communication</h4>
                    <p>You may provide data to us for support purposes or when contacting us, in email and through social platforms like Twitter. This helps us communicate with you and sort out issues you may be having. This could be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic Information – things like your name and an account name.</li>
                        <li>Contact information – such as an email address and Twitter account.</li>
                        <li>Unique identifiers – this could be identifiers for devices and Advertising IDs.</li>
                        <li>Configuration – specifics such as browser used, language, general location, precise location (GPS if allowed) device type, version of software and operating system.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>How your data is kept and accessed</h4>
                    <p>We keep the majority of data in your devices or in secure third-party services that use technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration. Data from communication is secured locally. We also have the following procedures in place:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Limit staff access to data – only giving access to staff that have legitimate business use.</li>
                        <li>Encrypt data – to make data not identifiable.</li>
                        <li>Policy Reviews - regular reviews of our data security procedures.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Our Services work globally and our Partners are also global. Your data can be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries can have different data protection laws, Nitrive and its Partners take steps to ensure safeguards are in place to protect your data when transferring it.
                    </p>

                    <p>We use Partners with a Privacy Shield certification and have contracts in place to enforce data is handled safely using industry-standard practices such as firewalls, encryption, password protection and access controls.
                    </p>

                    <p>Whilst we do our best to protect your data, when transmitting data to us, we cannot guarantee the security of that data. Any transmission is at your own risk. We do not actively monitor the security of all Services and need to rely on our Partners to notify us of any data breaches.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How long data is kept for
                    </h4>
                    <p>We will try to get rid of any data we don’t need and if you want us to remove your data, see the what you can do section.
                    </p>

                    <p>Data, such as game save files and your profile, that is needed to run the Service will be held for as long as you need our Services. Our Partners may have different policies on how long they keep data so we encourage you to use the links in the what Partners we use section, and review their privacy policies.
                    </p>

                    <p>Where we can, we aim to keep data for only 26 months unless it is needed to run the Service or if it is needed for “legitimate business interests”. Legitimate business interests means we need it to help with any legal issue that may come up, such as to resolve any issues with our agreements or to provide details of revenue for tax purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What the data is used for
                    </h3>
                    <p>When either ourselves or our Partners use the data, we may group and segment it to make the data more usable. This can be data from different sources and is used to find patterns and trends. To provide great Services to you, we have a legitimate interest to collect and process necessary data.
                    </p>

                    <p>We may also disclose your data to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our players or others. We will only disclose information with your consent where we are legally able.
                    </p>
                    <h4>To improve our Services
                    </h4>

                    <p>We want to make a great product for you and we need data to do that so we may monitor, analyse, profile and segment data to do this. This means we may group data and reference data to see if we can identify patterns. We use this data for things like adjusting the game difficulty, seeing and fixing a crash or to show you events based on your location.
                    </p>

                    <p>We use data to provide support with the Services in terms of issues specific to you, and answer questions you may have.
                    </p>

                    <p>We use data to save your status and preferences so the Service is tailored to you, for example, we make sure each time you play it is in the language of your choosing and ensure you can play from where you left off. Sometimes this means we have to make or update an account or profile for you.
                    </p>

                    <h4>To make Services more social
                    </h4>
                    <p>We believe some Services need to have social elements. Because of this, we may offer and link to other Partners social features to help you communicate with others.
                    </p>
                    <p>We may moderate chats either automatically or manually so we may need to monitor the use of the Service and its social features.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other users will be able to see things you have shared.
                    </p>

                    <h4>To make money</h4>
                    <p>We need money to keep making games.
                    </p>
                    <p>We use data to show adverts that are more relevant to you, which pay more because Advertisers show less of them to get customers. As they pay more, we make more money from these targeted adverts meaning we can make more games and updates, and show less adverts.
                    </p>
                    <p>We also get revenue from payments and need to store records of transactions.</p>

                    <h4>Communicate with you</h4>

                    <p>We use your data to communicate with you according to your preferences, when we think you may need information about the Services we provide such as support messages and important updates.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What you can do
