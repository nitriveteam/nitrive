<p><strong>International data transfers</strong></p>



<p>Our Services are global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world.

Adequate safeguards to ensure your rights include utilizing and enforcing the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data retention</h2>



<p>We will keep your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide you with the Services or to comply with any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We periodically delete or de-identify inactive accounts or other data in our Services.</p>



<p>After the applicable retention period, we will either delete or de-identify your personal data or, if neither deletion or de-identification is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), isolate your data from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible. We may continue to use any data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregated data).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How we protect your data</strong></h2>



<p>In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.</p>



<p>All data security measures are adopted in order to provide a level of security appropriate for the degree of risk involved. These measures are designed to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration as well as unauthorized disclosure or access. The specific measures typically include, encryption in transit, pseudonymization of identifying data where feasible, controls to limit access to services or systems that contain personal data, and maintaining procedures to handle any suspected security incidents. Please consider that the internet is an inherently insecure environment and we cannot guarantee absolute security for your data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Your rights and options</strong></h2>



<p><strong><em>Your rights regarding your personal data</em></strong></p>



<p>You have the right to a copy of your personal information to be supplied to you in an electronic format upon request.</p>

<p><strong>12. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>



<p>You and Nitrive agree that the processes for dispute resolution described in this agreement will apply to any dispute or claims related to these Terms, the Nitrive Privacy Policy, or the Services. Disputes include any claims of any kind, including but not limited to legal, equitable, or statutory claims. Processes for dispute resolution will apply even if you stop using your Account, delete your Account, or stop using the Service. They will also apply to disputes that arose before we entered into this agreement.</p>



<p><strong>Sections 12.1 to 12.6 only apply to residents of the United States or Canada. They do not apply to you if you are a resident of any other country.</strong></p>



<p><strong>12.1 Informal Dispute Resolution</strong></p>



<p>You must try to informally resolve any dispute directly with Nitrive for at least thirty days before starting an arbitration. The period for informal dispute resolution starts when you have given notice to Nitrive of the dispute via email to legal-disputes@Nitrive.com.</p>



<p><strong>12.2 Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>



<p>You and Nitrive agree to resolve any disputes exclusively in final and binding arbitration as follows:</p>



<p>Either you or Nitrive may choose to submit any dispute for resolution by final and binding arbitration unless the claim is within the exceptions described below. If a claim is brought to court that can be resolved by arbitration under this section, either party can ask the court to order the parties to resolve the claim by arbitration. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to decide whether any portion of Section 12 is valid or enforceable, or whether it applies to a claim.</p>



<p>An arbitration proceeding will be held before a neutral arbitrator. <strong>This means you and Nitrive agree to give up the right to resolve the dispute in a trial before a judge or jury</strong>. Arbitration has different rules than formal lawsuits. E.g. the ability to force the other side to share information may be limited under arbitration compared to discovery in formal lawsuits. A decision by an arbitrator is final and its outcome cannot be changed by a court outside of very limited circumstances. Either you or Nitrive can ask a court to confirm or enter the arbitrator’s final decision or award, which will make it the same as a binding court judgement. You and Nitrive will generally not be able to change the outcome of arbitration through courts outside of very limited circumstances.</p>



<p><strong>12.3. Arbitration Process</strong></p>



<p>The arbitration will be run by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). AAA’s rules and procedures will be used for the arbitration, including the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and AAA’s rules and procedures, these Terms of Service will be followed. To review AAA’s Rules or to start arbitration, you can go to <a href="https://adr.org/">AAA’s website</a>. If either you or Nitrive decides to start arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>



<p>The fees for arbitration will be determined by AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the arbitrator decides that those fees are excessive, Nitrive will pay the fees. Each side will pay their own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the claims allow for the prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees and costs, in which case the arbitrator may award them under the applicable law. If either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity of the arbitrator’s decision or award through a subsequent court case, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.</p>



<p>The arbitration will take place either in San Francisco, California, USA or in the county or province where you reside.</p>



<p><strong>12.4. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>



<p>You and Fingesoft agree that the arbitration agreement in Section 12.2. above will not apply in the following disputes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Claims about Nitrive’s intellectual property, such as claims to enforce, protect, or concerning the validity of Nitrive’s copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, patents, trade secrets, or any other other intellectual property rights.</li>



<li>Claims related to piracy or tortious interference.</li>



<li>Claims that are not subject to arbitration agreement as a matter of law and are not preempted by federal law that would allow for an agreement to arbitration.</li>



<li>Claims in small claims court.</li>
</ul>



<p>Any dispute not subject to arbitration under these exceptions shall be resolved by a federal or state court located in San Francisco, California. You and Nitrive consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California for all such claims or disputes.</p>



<p><strong>12.5. No Class Actions</strong></p>



<p>You and Nitrive agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.</p>



<p>That means:</p>



<ul>
<li>You cannot bring a claim against Nitrive as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.</li>



<li>The arbitrator cannot combine any other person’s claims with yours into a single case or preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding.</li>



<li>The arbitrator’s decision or award in your case will not apply to anyone else and cannot be used to decide other people’s disputes.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>12.6. Opt-Out of Arbitration Agreement an No Class Action Provisions</strong></p>



<p>You can choose to opt out of and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement and No Class Action provisions above (Sections 12.1. to 12.5.) by sending a written notice of your decision to opt out to legal-disputes@Nitrive.com with the subject line “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT”. You must send us this notice within thirty days of your first use of the Service or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later. If you do not send us a notice within that time, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these Sections.

<p><strong>19. No Waiver</strong></p>



<p>The failure of Nitrive to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or the Nitrive Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Nitrive’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p>



<p>The express waiver by Nitrive of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms or the Nitrive Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>
